# After you install apache server (probably through xamp), 

# To start the web server :
sudo systemctl start apache2

#to get the status
sudo systemctl status apache2

#to stop the server
sudo systemctl stop apache2

#to restart the server
sudo systemctl restart apache2

#The folder of the apache server is here :
/var/www/html


#these folders can be of use :
/usr/lib/apache2/modules
/etc/apache2/mods-available
#unfortunately I didn't find this folder (maybe because of my installation) :
/usr/local/apache2
#nevertheless I created it.


#To make git work on an Apache Server you'll need to enable dav to actively push changes over http
https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/setup-git-server-over-http.txt
#and then you might want to use this 
git http-push http://localhost/my_git_project master #not sure

- httpd.conf was not found in /etc/apache2/. I created it and added 		Include /etc/apache2/httpd.conf		in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
- In httpd.conf I added 		LoadModule dav_fs_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_dav_fs.so
- In /etc/apache2/apache2.conf in <Directory /var/www/> I added Dav On
- sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/   #www-data is the user and group found in etc/apache2/envvars

#Unfortunately all this didn't let the apacher server start; it threw the following error :
#Invalid command 'Dav', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration


#Another method is probably to use 		Smart HTTP
